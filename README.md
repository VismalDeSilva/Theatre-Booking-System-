# Theatre-Booking-System
Created a user-friendly program in Java that allows customers to easily select and   
     reserve seats in a cinema. Employed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to  
     design a robust system where each seat is represented as an object, facilitating efficient 
     management and tracking of bookings.
